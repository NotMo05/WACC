# WACC Compiler Project

This project involves creating a simple compiler for a custom programming language, **Whimsical Ada Compiler Construction (WACC)**. The goal is to design both the front-end (parsing and syntax analysis) and the back-end (code generation and optimization) of the compiler.

## Overview

- **Project Type**: Compiler Construction
- **Languages Used**: C, Flex, Bison
- **Key Features**:
  - Parsing of custom language syntax
  - Semantic analysis and error checking
  - Code generation to intermediate language
  - Basic optimization techniques
